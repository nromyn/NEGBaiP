I also used to go to the highway to pick up groceries for Agnes, this would be before your time Ed , meet the National Grocer's truck and load the boat. My childhood friend Diana Clark (Gillian Howard's Mother) would come with me We were allowed to use Joan's (Agnes" daughter) boat, it was a Peterborough Handyboy with a steering wheel and a 40 hp.. We had many a trip and used to race any other boats in the river. I also spent many a time at the Key Jct. station, either going down to the Harbour on the Jitney or returning from the Harbour to come home. Going to the harbour on the Mixed was during the day and we had to pack a big lunch. Coming back to Capreol we had to get to the Junction in the night and catch the northbound passenger. I can remember running alongside the train my hand in each of my parent's and getting on board as we had almost missed it. A tree had fallen across the tracks going to the junction and the jitney arrived late .At the Harbour, . We got off right at Pete Murray's walkway which later became Agnes's walkway and area where she had her new store constructed. The best of times!

My good friend Mike Cadeau found this and knowing my love of the area sent it to me. I'd like to share it all with you. I am going to try and take the ATV to the location this coming summer and take an up to date picture. Believe it or not I remember the station as we used it quite a lot when I was young and rode the Jitney to the Lodge to go to camp (Paul Michaud's place now).

Later, after Hurd's moved their camp from Ludgate area to the highway, and when I was a young teen I worked for Agnes Trott. Use to take the big cedar strip boat to the railway bridge and wait for CN to drop off the National Grocers order. Load it, try not to sink the overloaded boat, and unload it at the store. It was a great time to be a teen. Occasionally the National Grocers order was left at the Ragot's gas station and home, where the big blue building sits now. Peggy and Mike were great people.

My parents would buy a ticket for their camping gear at Union Station in Toronto and have it shipped up to Key Harbour by train. That way they could pick it up on the dock at Key Harbour Lodge to avoid overloading their car and rental boat!

It was all ways about 4 in the morning when the train dropped us off and then into the gigger what about 8 or 9 miles to the Harbour to the waiting Pappa's fishing boat the phantom

## Ed Long replying

Marlene Pasivirta I imagine you came south from Capreol as we did on occasion (both my Grandfather and dad worked for CN and rode free on passes); although most of the time we came north from Toronto. I too recall arriving in the dark and walking east to Bob Hunters place where my grandfather's (Henry Long) boat was pulled up on the beach. Remember a trip or two in the daylight as well. Every time I stood up to look out the back windows someone told me to sit down.
