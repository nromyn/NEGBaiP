Robert “Bob” Young and his wife emigrated from Belfast, Ireland, to French River Mouth before the turn of the century. Bob initially worked in the Ontario Lumber Company mill before later becoming the government lighthouse keeper.  

Each day he rowed out to the light on Lefroy Island, a considerable distance from the village, and a hazardous trip whenever the waters were rough.  

One autumn, while tending the light, Bob was accidentally struck by a ricocheting bullet, likely fired by deer hunters. The shot wounded his side, arm, and hand, though it lacked enough force to lodge in the lighthouse. The spent bullet, of an unusual calibre for that era, was recovered. Despite his injuries, Bob managed to row back to the village, where his friend Jim McIntosh rushed him by boat to Parry Sound Hospital. He eventually recovered.  

On another occasion, while Bob was away servicing the lights, thieves broke into his home and stole clothing and family possessions.  

Tragedy struck in the early 1930s when Bob’s wife died during the harsh midwinter months. Alone in the remote settlement, and unable to bury her in the frozen ground, he built a coffin and kept her body in a back room until help arrived. Members of the King family, lumbering near Bad River, came with a horse-drawn sleigh and transported Mrs Young’s body to Parry Sound for burial.  

The Youngs had two daughters: one married and moved away; the other married Charlie Moore but died at a young age.  

After his wife’s death, Bob remained at 40 Main Street, long after the once-bustling street had become overgrown with weeds and bushes. He lived alone with his faithful black-and-white collie, acting as the self-appointed caretaker of the ghost town. He also guided tourists who ventured to visit the ruins.  

In his later years Bob became frail and undernourished. In 1934, his lifelong friend Jim McIntosh took him, along with his few belongings, by boat to Parry Sound to recuperate. Once strong enough, Bob returned to Ireland, never again to see his beloved French River Mouth.
