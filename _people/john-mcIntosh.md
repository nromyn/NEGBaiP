## John McIntosh and Family

John, eldest son of Peter McIntosh, married Georgina (née Shaw). They moved from Collingwood to French River Mouth to live there in 1902. John captained one of the tugs on the upper river for the French River Boom and Raft Company. He soon became manager of the company and he held this position until it closed down in 1921, at which time he bought the company and ran it until 1929.

John and Georgina raised their family on the McIntosh homestead located on the east shore of Macdougal Bay, south of Wabbtown, in the town plan of Coponaning. They had five boys and two girls: Reginald, Douglas, Webster (Jim), Robert (Pat), Elsie, and Gean.

When John became manager of the boom company, his brother Peter took over as captain of the tug Evelyn. His brothers Ben and Bill both worked in the lumber industry. The lumber company built an office and living quarters on a floating log raft above the Dalles Rapids.

Other tugs used on the river were the Elsie Mack and Maggie McKlane. They plied up and down the French and Pickerel Rivers from Boom Island, where the logs were held and sorted, to go downriver.

Some of John’s sons, when they were old enough, helped their father on the tugs and with other duties pertaining to the Boom Company and the many aspects of the lumbering business.

## Log Rafting and the Move to Parry Sound

John McIntosh formed the large log rafts at French River Mouth to be towed across the bay. With two large tugs pulling the raft, he would use his tug to push by running the tug into the back and centre of the raft. This was done at night so the boom would be on the north side of the Bustards by daylight, ready to start across the bay, weather permitting.

In 1921 the family moved to Parry Sound to live. This was so the children could receive their schooling — the school at Coponaning had closed. The family returned to work each summer until 1934.

During the Depression years John was the Relief Administrator in the Parry Sound area. He started the building of the road north from Parry Sound to Britt, which is now Highway 69. This project gave work to men receiving relief, for which they were expected to work.

## The McIntosh Sawmill

In 1931 John and his five sons built a sawmill on the east shore of Macdougal Bay near the homestead. In the mill they cut lumber from salvaged logs. The family had obtained the rights to all deadhead sunken logs in the area. The family ran the mill until 1937. From 1938 to 1940, Pat and Gordon operated the mill, but closed it down during the war years.

## Later Years

John McIntosh died in 1945 and Mrs. McIntosh in 1949. Three of their sons — Reg, Webster (Jim), and Robert (Pat) — spent most of their lives living and working at different occupations in the French River Mouth and Key River area.
