Dean Udy, who served variously as storekeeper, magistrate, and game warden when required, ran the Ontario Lumber Company store. After the company closed, he continued to operate the store and post office until 1922. He was well known in the area. Dean and his wife had a daughter, Alberta, and a son, Bert.  

In 1923, Dean Udy left French River Village and moved to Pine Lake on the upper Pickerel River, where the original mill from French River Mouth had been relocated and rebuilt in 1912. At Pine Lake he built and operated a store and post office until his death in 1930.  

Over the thirty to forty years the mills were in operation at French River Mouth, millions of logs were floated downstream in river drives along the Wanapitei, Pickerel, and French Rivers, either in raft booms or singly. Each company stamped its ownership mark into the ends of its logs before the downstream trip.  

Most log booms or rafts were assembled upriver on the French, where tugs operated by John and Peter McIntosh towed them downstream. Their crews travelled upriver to various staging areas, where the logs were sorted and bound into rafts and booms. These were towed downstream to a holding area above the Dalles Rapids, then floated through the rapids to Macdougal Bay and the mills below. Some logs were sawn into lumber, while others were bound into immense rafts.  

These enormous rafts, containing thousands of logs, were gathered in the Macdougal Bay Channel at the mouth of the French River. From there, they were towed and pushed to the leeward north side of the Bustard Islands, where they waited for favourable winds and weather. When conditions were calm, the long tow across Georgian Bay began, bound for many Great Lakes ports.  

John McIntosh and his Boom Company staff assembled these rafts using the tugs *Elsie Mac* and *Audrey C*. They pushed the rafts, often working through the night, out to the Bustards holding area. The rafts were secured by heavy chains or cables fastened end-to-end through logs, encircling thousands of loose timbers to form a floating fortress of lumber.
