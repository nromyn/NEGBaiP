## Early Tourist at French River Mouth

## Conover – Early Tourists at French River Mouth  

Warren Conover, one of the original partners and founders of the Johnson Motors Company in South Bend, Indiana, often recalled his first journeys to the French River Mouth and the surrounding fishing grounds.  

The Conovers were among the earliest tourists to frequent the area. Warren first visited in 1924, when his party travelled to Bud West’s Camp on Ox Lake for a fishing holiday. Their journey began in Indiana, driving north via Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury, then continuing by CNR train to Pickerel Station, before finally travelling by boat downriver to West’s Camp.  

From the camp, they would often continue downriver to a spot just above the Dalles Rapids. There they left their canoe, carried their outboard motor along a well-defined trail to a point below the rapids, and fitted it onto an old boat that was kept waiting there. From this base they fished the Bay waters and, when conditions allowed, ventured as far as the Bustard Islands. On other days they explored the channels and islands of the lower Bad River. The fishing was so good that they rarely felt the need to push farther out into the open Bay.  

In 1931 Warren returned with his family, beginning a long association with the French River. One of his last visits came in 1942, when he and his wife Lutie travelled with friends Clyde and Mrs. Ault. The Conovers made their final trip to West’s Camp in 1945. Together Warren and Lutie had two children, Warren Clay and Helen.  

The family witnessed much of the gradual decline of French River Village, Coponaning, as it faded into memory after the mill era ended. Photographs they kept capture the village during its years of deterioration.  

Lutie Conover passed away in the 1960s. Warren later remarried and settled in Rockport, Indiana. Their son, Warren Clay Conover, made return visits to the region with his family in the 1950s and again in the 1970s, fishing the Bustard Islands and visiting Key Harbour, carrying on the family’s connection to the French River.
