The first relatives of the McIntosh family to come to Coponaning, after the Wabb family, were the Moores on Mrs. Peter McIntosh’s side. She was a Moore. The Moores arrived in the late 1880s. Peter and his family came to work at French River Mouth in 1890. Both families were from Collingwood. Peter McIntosh had four sons: John, Peter, Ben, and Bill.

Captain Peter McIntosh owned and operated the first steam-powered wooden tug at French River. It was named Coponaning. With his tug he towed the sailing ships that called there for lumber products, in and out of the narrow hazardous navigational channel to open water where the ships then could make sail. One of the sailing ships visiting French River was the Tollamie. There are no records, but it is presumed Peter used the tug for other duties around the harbour.

In the spring of 1906, he and most of his crew drowned near the Bustard Islands when the Coponaning sprang a plank and quickly sank. One crew member survived. Peter was buried in Britt cemetery opposite the Roman Catholic church. The headstone reads:

“Captain Peter McIntosh, Born Mar. 2, 1855. Drowned at Bustard Islands April 30, 1906.”
