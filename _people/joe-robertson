Joe Robertson was a late comer to French River Village
in the late 1920â€™s. He had moved some buildings from upper French River to Georgian Bay and helped build part of Georgian Bay Camp. He also dismantled the Presbyterian Church and other buildings which he sold for used lumber. Joe was one of the best guides in the area.
