*From the Winter 2000 edition of the KRAA newsletter, written by Susan McKay.*

The coal dock was built by the Canadian National Railway Bride and Building Department, headquarters in [Capreol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capreol), in 1908. The CN had coal shipped into Key Harbour from various coal mines they owned in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Ships owned by the [Pioneer Steamship Company (Hutchinson and Company fleet)](https://www.victoriaharbourhistory.com/pioneer-steamship-line/#:~:text=Pioneer%20Steamship%20Line%20William%20Irving%E2%80%99s%20Pioneer%20Line%20was,in%20Victoria%20as%20The%20British%20Columbia%20Coastal%20Service.) carried the coal. Ships were approximately 300 feet in length and carried approximately 7000 tonnes. Coal was the main operation at Key Harbour in the beginning. It was stockpiled just south of Capreol, at Hammer Pit for CNR Northem Division operation. It was also brought in for the Ontario Northland Railway and for International Nickel Company smelters. All locomotives backed into Key Harbour, ran around the consist of cars and wore then able to pull the loaded cars out to the main line the [Bala Subdivision](http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Bala.html). Each locomotive was equipped with "sanders' over the driving wheels of the engine in order to get traction to pull. There was a [Wye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wye_(rail)) at Key Junction where the engines could change direction. The CNR coal dock was built completely of wood pilings and ties. It ran straight west from the mainland at the end of track. It was built 1,200 feet long and was three tracks wide. There was a wooden catwalk from the inside centre over to the electric power generating building or powerhouse on the north shore. When more than one ship was in port waiting to be unloaded, they anchored close to the southwest side of the docks.

[Brown hoists](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.c2c6cda56a1dedf6157cc7d70e4e626b?rik=wBFGokcSqakonw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fimg.auctiva.com%2fimgdata%2f2%2f7%2f9%2f0%2f2%2f3%2fwebimg%2f393245512_o.jpg&ehk=YuKbJn2QfGrQlkSEZM7klkbZvvshfBLI%2bbu5Q%2fGZDT0%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0) were used to unload the ships. They were coal burning, steam-powered hoists using a two-yard capacity clam. The brown hoists operated on a raised track six feet higher on the shipside of the dock. The clam lifted coal from the hold of the ship over the track and dropped into the coal cars on the next track. The men worked 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day, while unloading a ship. It took between 42 and 48 hours to complete unloading. The coal dock was later used for the commercial fishing industry.

The iron ore dock was also constructed in 1908 for the purpose of handling the iron orc output from the Moose Mountain Iron Mines north of Capreol, Shipments over the dock were relatively light (exceeding 100,000 tonnes in only one year - 1913) the life of the orc dock was short, with the final loading being made in 1916, and the structure being dismantled in 1924. The ore dock had many innovations. It was of an original design and unlike any other dock on the Great Lakes for handling iron ore at that time. Most interesting was the fact that at this early date, 1908, conveyor belts were used to elevate the ore from the railroad car dumping point to the dock trestle. The Key Harbour ore dock consisted of earth fill and a pile trestle extending out into the deep water of Key Inlet. 

The wooden dock structures included a storage shed 600 feet in length located on the shore, an incline 500 feet in length, and the loading dock 300 feet long and 24 feet wide with conventional pockets and spouts on one side, 60 feet high. Ore from the mines, loaded in hopper-bottomed cars, was dumped from a high line inside the storage shed to a stockpile beneath.

Under this stockpile in line with the centre line of the trestle; was a tunnel through which a conveyor belt operated. This "tunnel belt" moved the ore to a similar belt at the power house point water's edge, which in turn elevated the ore to the dock trestlc-60 feet above water level. The ore was then tripped off the belt and then dumped into pockets from which it was spouted into the hold of vessels alongside the dock.

The first ore was loaded at Key Harbour in the year 1909 and the last ore was dumped into vessels in 1916, when two small cargoes, carried over from the previous year, were loaded for [Deseronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseronto) (eastern Lake Ontario). Generally the ships carried approximately 4000 tonnes of orc outbound. The ore was transported down from Sellwood, a small CN town, close to Moose Mountain Mine, on special 21 ore car trains, hauled by what is known as a light locomotive. This locomotive brought 7 cars into the storage house at the Harbour each run and it required about 1 hour to dump a 21 car train. The run from the yard to the storage house was about ¾ mile. The train moved into the ore storage house on a timber trestle high line. Along each side of the track was a plank walk way about 4 ft. above the rail where the men walked while dumping the cars. The cars were of the centre dump type dumping down and outwards against the wheel, but clear of the inner axles. From this stockpile of ore the convey or belts took over and the employment this medium for transporting orc was quite advanced for that early date.

When American ships came in or out, papers had to be processed at the Customs office. The Customs office is where I [Susan McKay] grew up and is now the Lambovitch cottage ({% assign target = site.properties | where: "map_number", "K09" | first %}{% if target %}<a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ target.url }}">#K09</a>{% else %}#K09{% endif%}). Dave Hudson, Arnold's father was on of the Customs officers. 

The commercial fishing industry used the coal dock for years afterwards, but once the steel was lifted and we no longer had a spur line from Key Junction to Key Harbour the dock started to fall apart.

I have some photographs of the operation which I am including here and though this information is not exactly about the Key River Area Association archives, I feel it is important to know about the commercial operation at Key Harbour.

There is so much history here and it is so interesting that want to include as much as I can.

# Mention in Skillings Report 

There are always a lot of questions about what went on at Key Harbour during the early days. I've covered quite a few interesting facts in my previous submissions, but I have never included the following. I copied this from Volume XLIII of the [Skillings Mining Report](https://skillings.net), published every Saturday morning in Duluth, Minnesota, on March 19, 1955. You might wonder how I got my hands on this newspaper. I worked for CN Rail, and on the corporate ladder, you always spent some time as a File Clerk. Since I was already interested in all things related to the Key, this just happened to fall into my hands.
Remember, this was written in 1955.

## Iron ore shipments from the Georgian Bay? 

A rather strange thought this is today when most of the fabulous tonnage of iron ore that moves across the Great Lakes each year comes from Lake Superior ports and one harbour on Lake Michigan. Shipments have been more or less standardized in the past four decades on the five U.S. and two Canadian ore shipping ports. But there are some among our readers, however, who will recall the day when the Georgian Bay was the scene of iron ore tumbling down long spouts into the holds of Lake ships, and we may all see ore shipments from this area resumed within the next few years. Yes, it was the iron ore loading dock of the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway located at Key Harbour, Ont. that was the site for those shipments.

This dock was constructed in the year 1908 for the purpose of handling the iron ore output from the Moose Mountain iron mines. Shipments over the dock were relatively light (exceeding 100,000 tons in only one year—1913) and the life of the dock was short with the final loadings being made in 1916 and the structure being dismantled in 1924.

Key Harbour, Ont., is located on Key Inlet, one of the many deep rocky indentations at the northeast extremity of Georgian Bay. The Key afforded a splendid natural harbour with ample depth of water in the channel and alongside the coal and ore docks for the largest vessels of that time. The ore dock was located on Georgian Bay at the entrance to Key Inlet and the channel leading to the dock had four principal courses, each marked by a pair of wooden day beacons and eight gas buoys. Ships could, thus, follow the markers to thread their way through the myriad of rocky islands, large and small, into the ore dock.

### Use Conveyor for Hoisting Ore
Aside from the unique location of this operation, the dock itself had many innovations. It was of an original design and unlike any dock on the Great Lakes for handling iron ore at that time or since. Most interesting, perhaps, was the fact that at this early date—1908, conveyor belts were used to elevate the ore from the railroad car dumping point to the dock trestle.

The Key Harbour ore dock consisted of earth fill and a pile trestle extending out into the deep water of Key Inlet. The wooden dock structures included a storage shed 600 feet in length located on the shore, an incline 500 feet in length, and the loading dock 300 feet long and 24 feet wide with conventional pockets and spouts on one side. Ore from the mines, loaded in hopper-bottomed cars, was dumped from a highline inside the storage shed to a stockpile ground beneath. Under this stockpile, in line with the centerline of the trestle, was a tunnel through which a conveyor belt operated. This tunnel belt moved the ore to a similar belt at the water's edge, which in turn conveyed and elevated the ore to the dock trestle—sixty feet above the water level. The ore was then tripped off the belt and dumped into pockets from which it was spouted into the holds of the vessels alongside the dock.

The first ore was loaded at Key Harbour in the year 1909 and the last ore was dumped into vessels in the year 1916 when 2 small cargoes, carried over from the previous year, were loaded for Deseronto. The ore that was handled over the Key Harbour ore dock originated at the Moose Mountain Mine about 80 miles north of the Harbour. The mine was located at the village of Sellwood, in Hutton Township of Ontario which is about 35 miles north of Sudbury, the nearest important centre. At the Moose Mountain Mine, much time and money was spent in an unsuccessful attempt to produce a high grade commercial product (including iron briquettes) from the lean siliceous magnetite of the iron formation. A branch of the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway from Toronto to Sudbury was built from Sudbury north to the mine at Sellwood, a distance of 35 miles. Another six-mile spur off the main line, from a few miles south of the French River, at a point called Key Junction, was constructed to the Key Harbour ore dock. This made rail haul for the ore moving down from the mine to the dock about 80 miles—about the same as the average haul of the iron ore carrying roads in Minnesota. The Key Harbour shipping point was sometimes nearer to the iron ore receiving ports than the head of Lake Superior.

# Freight Rates

The freight rates that were in existence in 1914 on iron ore shipments from Sellwood, Ontario, rather interesting to note and were as follows:

|---|
|To Sault Ste. Marie – all rail|$1.60|
|To Parry Sound – all rail|$1.00|
|To Deseronto – all rail|$1.55|
|To Key Harbour - including loading into boats to Canadian Ports |$0.65|

The lake freight rate from Key Harbour and Lake Erie ports in 1914 was 40 cents and in 1914 it was 35 cents.

At that time there was an import duty of 40 cents per ton on ore shipped to the U.S. A good share of the ore that moved out over the Key Harbour dock was consigned to the Oglebay Norton & Co. and was unloaded at Toledo. There is record of some of the iron briquettes being shipped to Cleveland for use in Republic Iron & Steel Corp.'s blast furnaces.

That's it for this one, but there is lots more to come, hope you find it as interesting as I do.
