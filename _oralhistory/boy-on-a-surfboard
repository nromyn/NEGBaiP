*Hugh on a Surfboard*

This photograph was handed to me by a former Key Harbour resident, Hugh McDonald. Hugh spent his summers in what we called "Mac's Shack" (K14). His parents came down for their summer vacation from Toronto and often times his father would go back to work and Hugh and his mother would stay a little longer. Mrs. Mac. always wore a lovely dress and hat, even when picking blueberries. On special occasions, like birthdays, she would make ice cream from scratch. We all took turns at churning the cream. It tasted so good and was such a treat. After the MacDonalds left, the box car/cottage was purchased by Coss Lyte for the school teachers who taught at the the Key Harbour School, 1951-1959, P.S. Henvey #1.

The cottage in which Hugh once spent his summers now belongs to Jack Lyte. Hugh visited Jack and saw his old home for the first time in many years. He said it brought back many good memories.

Hugh believes this photo was probably taken in 1947 or 1948. The boat that is pulling Hugh is one built by Edwin Aalto. Edwin says he first had a six cylinder Plymouth engine in her and then later, installed a V-8, and, according to Edwin and Hugh ,"she would dangle". So this is probably the very first surf board being pulled by the very first inboard built by Edwin, skimming down the Key River, 64 years ago. The water was higher then.
Hugh, who returned to the Key several years ago, at my invitation, after a 50 year absence, says the feeling is still there for him, but things have sure changed. He was a constant at our cottage when he was there as a young man, I think it had something to
go with my sisters and my cousins, and the Lyte girls and Emily Murray, all in close proximity to "Denny's Den" {% assign target = site.properties | where: "map_number", K09 | first %}{% if target %}<a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ target.url }}">#K09</a>{% else %}#K09{% endif%}. The pictures taken from that period of time, show Hugh, right in the midst of all the girls. Thank goodness for great memories.

Emily Murray Pillgrem says she can recall Hugh, who was in his teens at the time, leaving the "Den" and walking down our path in front of Murray's store and Post Office, singing "Streets of Laredo" at the top of his lungs. 

So here you see the first surfboard rider on the Key River being pulled by Edwin Aalto in the first inboard boat he built.
