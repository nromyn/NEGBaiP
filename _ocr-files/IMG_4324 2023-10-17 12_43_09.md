Cam-A -K ey, MacLeod ’s Camp in 1970

Over the years George’s mother Emma, and her sister
Angelina Pilon, helped to run and manage the camp for him.
He sold it in 1960 to Canadian Sportsmans Service and
Associates managed by William and Marion Campbell.

George then moved back to Capreol where the MacLeods
had their permanent home, and spent the winter months
there while Operating the resort at Key Harbour. After
moving back, he took a position with Lowphos Ore Min-
Ing Company. He was employed there until a sudden
sickness, and died in 1973.

George is survived by his mother, of Capreol, sister
Audrey, Mrs. Loukidelis of Parry Sound, and his brother
Jim who works for the federal government as head of the
English Indexing Branch in Ottawa.

The original MacLeod’s Camp is still a thriving tourist
establishment at Key Harbour. After George died, it has
been known as “Cam-A-Key’’ resort; owned and operated
by William and Leatha Campbell until October 1979 when
it was sold to Dave and Patricia Powell. The Powells now
call the camp ‘‘Diamond Key’’. The Powells have made
many improvements.
