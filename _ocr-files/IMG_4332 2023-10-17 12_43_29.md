CAPTAIN RICKLEY ¢ BRITT, DEAD ISLAND

He was a pound net fisherman from Britt. He set his nets
south of Dead Island, where he also had an outpost camp
located where the Government dock is today. The Captain
*was a little lame. He was well known for his strong deep
voice. Some said when he caught a 9 ft. 7 inch sturgeon, they
could hear him hollering clear to Key Harbour. When he
packed the sturgeon to be shipped from the Bustard Islands
on one of the Owen Sound Transportation Boats, it took
three regular fish boxes to carry it. Captain Rickley fished
out of Britt around 1910 until the 30’s. It has been said that
he boiled up rattlesnake meat for soup and thoroughly
enjoyed it.
