The first relatives of the McIntosh family to come to Coponaning, after the Wabb family, Were The Moores on Mrs. Peter McIntosh’s side. She was a Moore. The Moores 
arrived in the late 1880's. Peter and his family came to work at French River Mouth in 1890. Both families were from Collingwood. Peter McIntosh had four
sons: John, Peter, Ben and Bill.

Captain Peter McIntos owned and operated the first steam powered  wooden tug at French River. It was named Coponaning.with his tug he towed the sailing ships that called there for lumber products, in and out of the narrow hazardous navigational channel to open water where the ships then could make sail. One of the sailing ships visiting French River was the "Tollamie". There are no records but it 1s presumed Peter used the tugfor other duties around the harbour.

In the spring of 1906 he and most of his crew drowned
near the Bustard Islands when the «‘Coponaning’’ sprang
a plank and quickly sank. One crew member survived. Peter
was buried in Britt cemetery opposite the Roman Catholic
church. The headstone reads, ‘‘Captain Peter Mcintosh
Born Mar. 2, 1855. Drowned at Bustard Islands April 30,
1906.”

John, eldest son of Peter McIntosh, married Georgina
(nee Shaw). They moved from Collingwood to French River
Mouth to live there in 1902. John captained one of the tugs
on the upper river for the French River Boom and Raft
Company. He soon became manager of the company and
he held this position until it closed down in 1921 at which
time he bought the company and ran it until 1929.

John and Georgina raised their family on the McIntosh
homestead located on the east shore of Macdougal Bay,
south of Wabbtown, in the town plan of Coponaning. They
had five boys and two girls: Reginald, Douglas, Webster
(Jim), Robert (Pat), Elsie and Gean.

When John became manager of the boom company, his
brother Peter took over as captain of the tug ““Evelyn’’. His
brothers Ben and Bill both worked in the lumber industry.
The lumber company built an office and living quarters on
a floating log raft above the Dalles rapids.

: Other tugs used on the river where the “Elsie Mack”’ and
Maggie McKlane . They plied up and down the French

and Pickerel Rivers from Boom Island where the logs were 
held and sorted to go down river. 

Some of John’s sons, when they were old enough h elpded
their father on the tugs  and other duties pertaining to the 
Boom Company and the many other aspects of the lumbering business. 

John McIntosh formed the large log rafts at french river Mouth to be towed across the bay . With two large tugs pulling the raft, he would use his tug  to push by running the tug into the back and centre of the raft. This was done at night so the boom would be on the north side of the Bustards by daylight, ready to start to across the bay, weather permitting. .

In 1921 the family moved to Parry Sound to live, This
was so the children could receive their schooling — th
school at Coponaning had closed. The family returned to
work each summer until 1934.

During the depression years John was the Relief 
Administrator in the Parry Sound area. He startedthe 
building of the road north from Parry Sound to Britt that
is now Highway 69. This project gave work to the met
receiving relief, which they were expected to work fo><:r.

In 1931 John and his five sons built a sawmill on the eas!
shore of Macdougal Bay near the homestead. In the mil
they cut lumber from salvaged logs. The family had obtain
the rights to all dead head sunken logs over the years inte
area. The family ran the mill until 1937. In 1938-1940 Pat an Gordon operated the mill, but closed it down during the war years.

John McIntosh died in 1945 and Mrs. mcintosh in 1949. 
Three of their sons Reg, Webster (Jim),and Robert (pat) 
spent most of their lives living and working at different oc
cupations in French River Mouth and Key river area
