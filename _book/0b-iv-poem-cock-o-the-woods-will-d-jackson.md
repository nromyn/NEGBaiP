An original poem by Will D Jackson, Dept. Scaler, Hearst, addressed to a pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) in a Northern Ontario forest.

O, Cock o’ the Woods, you’re a likeable chap
A gentleman o’ the tall timber,
With your tux’ an’ white shirt, your bright scarlet cap;
An’ snake-neck so lithe and so limber.
Now won’t you come down from that great hemlock tree
An’ talk to a shabby ol’ woodsman like me
Whose clothes are all faded, whose age is past mellow?
Come down while I rest here, ye elegant fellow!

That’s better – yon birch tree is farther from Heaven –
We can talk much more intimate now,
O’ things we’ve in common like deep-forest livin’,
An’ contempt for broad fields and the plow.
Your wild tattoo … your rat-a-tat-tat affects me like rare old champagne…
Don’t hesitate, my well-dressed friend, to drill that dead birch tree again.
Some lads say you’re a noisy clown…
But with them I don’t agree…
Whatever they may wish to call you, chum, you’re the Cock o’ the Woods to me!

Yes, Cock O’ the Woods, you’re a handsome big jigger…
But I’ll be as far well dressed, by an’ by,
In that far-away Land where I’ll go, so I figger,
‘Fore many more moons cross the sky;
An’ I hope, when I get there, the first thing I’ll see
Perched high in a Heavenly hemlock tree,
A-whackin His brains out ofr insect foods
Will be you, my old friend, the Cock o’ the Woods
