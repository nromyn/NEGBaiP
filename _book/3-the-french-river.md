Although the Indigenous peoples who roamed Ontario several hundred years ago no doubt had a name for the waterway that led them to and from Georgian Bay, it was not until [Champlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain) travelled the river in 1615 that it became known to Europeans and was given the name *la rivière des Français*.  

After Champlain’s discovery of this waterway to the West, there followed in his steps, between 1629 and 1649, the many [Récollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recollects) and [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits) Fathers who went to live amongst the [Huron-Wendat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendat_Nation). Fathers [Brébeuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Br%C3%A9beuf) and [Lalemant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_Lalemant) were two of the Martyrs of [Fort Ste. Marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Marie_among_the_Hurons), who met their deaths at the hands of the [Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois), deadly enemies of the French and their Huron-Wendat allies. At this time, the Haudenosaunee controlled most of the lands surrounding the lower Great Lakes.  

Then came the explorers. Some were men of the cloth, such as [Jean-Louis Hennepin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Hennepin), [Dollier de Casson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Dollier_de_Casson), [René de Galinée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_de_Br%C3%A9hant_de_Galin%C3%A9e), and [Jacques Marquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Marquette). Others were the *coureurs de bois* or traders: [Jean Nicolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Nicolet), [Pierre Radisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Esprit_Radisson), [Médard des Groseilliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9dard_des_Groseilliers), [La Vérendrye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gaultier_de_Varennes,_sieur_de_La_V%C3%A9rendrye) and his sons, to name a few. With great courage and determination, they travelled the French River to explore *le pays d’en haut*.  

There followed, too, the English explorers: [Simon Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Fraser_(explorer)), [David Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thompson_(explorer)), [Alexander Mackenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mackenzie_(explorer)), [Alexander Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Henry_the_elder), and many others — some on their own, and others in the employ of the great fur-trading companies, the [Hudson’s Bay Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company) and the [North West Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Company).  

Of the fur traders and the brigades of canoes which travelled back and forth on the river for many years, much could be, and has been, written.

## The Portages  

This river, some 60 miles long, full of grandeur and treacherous rapids, was for many years the only route to and from the West which could be travelled safely by these early voyageurs. After many days of hard paddling and difficult portaging up the Ottawa River from Lachine (Montreal) to the height of land near Mattawa, it was with relative ease that they crossed Lake Nipissing and travelled down the French River to *la mère douce* (Lake Huron). On the return trip, the portages on the French were taken more lightly, with the knowledge that the Ottawa River and the long stretch home were downstream.  

What stories could be told of these early travellers — the correspondence and messages they carried back and forth, telling of their trials and tribulations, of their discoveries and defeats…

### Editor’s Notes  

- The original text referred to Indigenous peoples as “Indians.” This has been replaced with “Indigenous peoples,” and specific nations are named where historically accurate.  
- Terms such as “deadly enemies” reflect the Eurocentric perspective of the time and simplify complex inter-nation relationships. They are left in place for historical accuracy but should be read critically.
