# First Summer Residents of Northeastern Georgian Bay

Probably the first people to visit the area were, as far as is now known, the Paleo Indians, sometime between 10,000 and 7,000 B.C. A workshop, quarry and habitation area has been excavated at the George Lake site near Killarney, and dated between 7,000 and 6,000 B.C. Here they made quartzite tools and weapons. Not much is known about them, but they probably fished and hunted along the north shore of Georgian Bay.

They were followed by Early Woodland Indians who left traces in the same area dated at 225 B.C. The Early Historic Indians, 1640-1760 A.D., were Algonquin tribes, Chippewas and Ojibwas to the northwest of the French River, and Ottawas to the south. Probably the Ottawas moved through a large territory as they were great water travelers and traders. The Ojibwas were more sedentary, and hunted, fished and raised some food closer to their homes. They lived on fish, venison, beaver, bear, moose and raccoons, as well as berries, corn and squash.

The Algonquins are the only eastern Indians who are essentially people of the water. One theory is that they came from the West Coast, or even Polynesia. They perhaps lived for a while with the Crees, and then moved farther east until they met the Iroquois. Similarities in their language and customs give some support to this theory. Their God Manitou is the counterpart of the Polynesian Maui. Their Heaven was not a continent of "Happy Hunting Groups", but an "Island in a Great Lake'.

Probably the earliest written description of the area was left to us by Champlain when he wrote of his journey by canoe in 1619. With Indian guides he traveled up the Ottawa River, across to Lake Nipissing then down the French River to Georgian Bay, which he called, "La Mer Douce - The Freshwater Sea." He was enthusiastic about the size and variety of the fish among the many islands, and thankful for the abundance of blueberries and raspberries that they found there, as their supplies were running low. They had been given corn by the Indians who grew it along the river near the bay. As they left the river and followed the shoreline they found a group of about 300 Indians who wore their hair neatly combed up high on their heads. They told him that they came there to pick and dry blueberries for the coming winter. The rest of the Eastern Shore, he said, was uninhabited until he reached the south end of the bay.

The early French explorers who followed Champlain from Montreal west to the Mississippi River took the Ottawas as guides. They became fighting allies of the French when the Iroquois allied themselves with the British. Pontiac was probably the best known Ottawa chief. In 1763 he and the Ottawas joined several other tribes and besieged Detroit for five months. They only gave up when their allies, the French, capitulated in the east. In 1795 the Ottawas signed a treaty with the United States and moved west into Michigan. Alter that they moved southwest, and in 1959 Ottawa Indians were mentioned in Oklahoma when the United States Government withdrew all supervision of Indians there.

Alter the Ottawas moved west in 1795, the Ojibwas moved southward. An Ojibwa chief was given land around the Muskoka River by the British as a reward for fighting with them against the Americans in 1812.

 Until the 1940's there were many Indian families living in the Northeastern Georgian Bay district. Mr. Archie Moore remembers that a member of the Missabi family was the Game Warden for many years.

Someday more early campsites will be found and excavated, so we can learn more about the earliest fishermen in the area.
