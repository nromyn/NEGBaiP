The earliest known visitors to the area were the Paleo-Indigenous peoples, sometime between 10,000 and 7,000 B.C. A workshop, quarry, and habitation site has been excavated at George Lake near Killarney, and dated between 7,000 and 6,000 B.C. Here, quartzite tools and weapons were produced. Not much is known about these early peoples, but they likely fished and hunted along the north shore of Georgian Bay.  

They were followed by Early Woodland peoples, who left traces in the same area dated to around 225 B.C. The Early Historic period, between 1640 and 1760 A.D., saw Algonquian-speaking peoples living in the region: the Anishinaabe (Chippewa and Ojibwe) to the north-west of the French River, and the Odawa to the south. The Odawa were renowned travellers and traders, often moving through wide territories. The Ojibwe were somewhat more settled, and hunted, fished, and cultivated crops closer to home. Their diet included fish, venison, beaver, bear, moose, raccoons, berries, maize, and squash.  

The Algonquian peoples are the only eastern Indigenous group often described as “people of the water.” One early theory, now largely discredited, speculated that they might have originated on the West Coast or even Polynesia. Some evidence suggested they lived for a time alongside the Cree before moving eastward into conflict and interaction with the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). Similarities in aspects of language and custom were once thought to support this idea. Their spiritual traditions included belief in Manitou, which writers of the time compared to figures in Polynesian mythology. Their afterlife was envisioned not as a continent of “Happy Hunting Grounds” [Editor’s note: a stereotype now recognised as dismissive], but as an “Island in a Great Lake.”  

Probably the earliest written description of the area was left by Champlain, who in 1619 described his journey by canoe. Guided by Indigenous leaders, he travelled up the Ottawa River, across to Lake Nipissing, and then down the French River to Georgian Bay, which he called *La Mer Douce* — *the Freshwater Sea*. He marvelled at the size and variety of the fish among the many islands, and was grateful for the abundance of blueberries and raspberries, which they found when their supplies were low. They had also been given maize by local farmers along the river near the Bay.  

As they travelled along the shoreline, they encountered a group of about 300 people harvesting and drying blueberries for the winter. Champlain noted that they wore their hair neatly tied high on their heads. Apart from this group, he described the eastern shore of the Bay as largely uninhabited until he reached the southern end.  

The French explorers who followed Champlain from Montreal west to the Mississippi River often relied on Odawa guides. The Odawa became allies of the French when the Haudenosaunee allied themselves with the British. Perhaps the most renowned Odawa leader was Pontiac, who in 1763, alongside the Odawa and allied nations, laid siege to Detroit for five months. The effort ended when their French allies capitulated in the east. In 1795 the Odawa signed a treaty with the United States and moved west into Michigan, later further south-west. Records mention Odawa communities in Oklahoma as late as 1959, when the United States Government withdrew formal oversight of Indigenous nations there.  

After the Odawa moved west in 1795, the Ojibwe moved further south. An Ojibwe leader was granted land along the Muskoka River by the British for supporting them against the Americans in the War of 1812.  

Until the 1940s, many Indigenous families lived in the north-eastern Georgian Bay district. Mr Archie Moore recalled that a member of the Missabie family served for many years as Game Warden.  

Someday more early campsites will be found and excavated, offering a clearer picture of the earliest fishing peoples of the region.

### Editor’s Notes  

- Terms such as “Indians” from the original text have been replaced with specific nation names or “Indigenous peoples.”  
- Some anthropological theories mentioned (e.g. Polynesian origins of Algonquian peoples) reflect speculative scholarship of earlier eras and are no longer accepted.  
- References such as “Happy Hunting Grounds” have been identified as stereotypes, and clarified for modern readers.
