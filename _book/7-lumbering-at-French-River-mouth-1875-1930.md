title:  "Lumbering at the French River Mouth, 1875–1930"

In 1872 the Honourable Thomas Foster, then Minister of Crown Lands of Ontario, obtained legislation and opened up a vast, previously untouched area to lumbering around the north-eastern shore of Georgian Bay and all rivers emptying into the Bay. This included the French River and all its tributaries.  

At this period of Ontario and Canada’s development (late 1800s to early 1900s), the cutting of the virgin pine forest, and the resulting lumbering, was a very important part of the country’s growth. The increased development of the industry in Georgian Bay was greatly encouraged by the reconstruction boom in the United States following the end of the Civil War and by increased immigration to Canada, especially Ontario.  

Large numbers of workers were required during the 40 to 50 years of this natural resource industry. At nearly all river mouths, mills and communities soon sprang up to accommodate the company workers and their families. Many such towns have now vanished.  

The lumberjacks, with axes and saws (mostly axes), cut these virgin forests from 80 to 100 miles inland for different lumber companies. The cutting areas were generally north and east from the French River mouth. Logging was done on both sides of the French, Pickerel, and Wanapitei Rivers, east to Lake Nipissing, and also west of the French River mouth to Voyageurs Channel. Most of these millions of logs were eventually processed through the mills or booming companies at Macdougal Bay, at the mouth of the French River, two miles inland from Georgian Bay.  

To process and produce finished lumber products from this vast timberland required large mills. The lumber companies and their mills were established at the mouth of the French River at Macdougal Bay. This location was the most central and accessible outlet to Georgian Bay and eventually to the vast commerce of the Great Lakes by boat and barge.

## "Wabb Town" and "Coponaning" — French River Village  

Sam Wabb, brother-in-law of Peter McIntosh, the father of John McIntosh, came to the French River mouth in the early 1870s to trade with local Indigenous peoples and others travelling the river. He was the first settler of European descent to make his home there.  

Sam built a large store and trading post, docks, and a house for his family. The buildings were located on the east shore of Macdougal Bay below the Dalles Rapids.  

Shortly after Sam arrived, and as the area was opened up to lumbering, companies obtained cutting leases and moved in. One of the first was the Walkerton Lumber Company, though they carried out little cutting in the early years compared to what followed. Around 1875 the companies began to build mills and townsites for their employees.  

Seeing the possibilities for additional income, Wabb built six to eight rough houses to rent to workers who were building and operating the mills. This small original settlement was appropriately called *Wabb Town*.  

After he was established there, his wife’s family, the Moores, and their relatives the McIntoshes from Collingwood, came and settled in Wabb Town. Sam continued his business until his death in 1915. Mrs Wabb and his sons operated the store until the 1920s, when they moved to Simcoe County near Barrie.

# Coponaning

In 1875 the Provincial Land Surveyor, Thomas Bolger of Belleville, was commissioned to survey a townsite at the mouth of the French River. He suggested the name *Coponaning*, under which the plan was registered. The town, however, did not develop immediately to any great extent until lumbering and milling really began in earnest. The north shore of Macdougal Bay in Bolger’s plan never developed, as the land was not required.  

At the beginning of Coponaning, the Walkerton Lumber Company and several smaller firms held leases in the area, but they did not engage in any extensive cutting. In 1883 the newly formed Ontario Lumber Company, owned by Herman H. Cook, his wife Lydia, Frank E. MacDonald, and John Melville Dollar, all of Toronto and Bracebridge, purchased Walkerton Lumber and its leases, limits, and rights. Also located at Coponaning were Bruce Mills, the French River Tug Company (later to become the French River Boom and Raft Company), and Irwin and Company Log Jobbers.  

In 1883 the Ontario Lumber Company began building its new mill and expanded operations in earnest. Their men and supplies were brought in from southern ports by paddle-wheel steamers. One of these was the *Asia*. The new townsite was established immediately south of the original town plan and was called **French River Village**.  

Coponaning–French River Village included a wide range of buildings: mills, houses, office buildings, boarding houses, library or reading rooms, doctor’s office, stables, two churches (Roman Catholic and Presbyterian), two schools (public and separate), three hotels (the *Coponaning House*, the *Queen’s Hotel*, and Joe Kelly’s Hotel, which stood just behind Reg McIntosh’s home), a jail, a brick warehouse, a shingle mill, and even a tunnel from the warehouse to the mill.  

The town’s streets were well organised, as laid out by Bolger (see map). The Department of Transportation maintained a building there as offices and housing for their staff, who were responsible for sounding water depths, carrying out surveying, and maintaining lighthouses and range lights in the area (see [Bustard Rocks Light article](/_book/bustard-rocks-light)).  

Coponaning boasted a year-round population of 1,200 to 1,400, with an additional 500 transient seasonal workers during its most productive years. The hotels were used mainly by short-term visitors.  

On the inner back bay, approaching the lighthouse, the pilings of the old ship-loading docks could still be seen [editor’s note: as of the early 1980s]. Here, vessels were loaded with cut timber from the mills. In the late 1800s sailing ships carried lumber from the port, later replaced by steam-powered vessels serving Ontario and U.S. destinations.  

The ship *Soo City* brought passengers, mail, and supplies for the stores and mills from Collingwood once a week. Other ships of the North Shore Navigation Company served Coponaning and neighbouring north shore ports. One ship, the *Favourite*, ran twice a week from about 1890 to 1895. Later, the Owen Sound Transportation Company served the town.  

As the lumber companies expanded, they put to good use the enormous quantities of sawdust and scrap lumber. These were used to fill gullies between rock ridges, creating additional streets. Where these sawdust-filled streets once lay, large trees now grow. In many places the sawdust has either become soil or washed away.  

Where some of the town’s residents had planted fruit trees many years ago, the offspring of the originals are still producing apples today (the writer sampled some in 1979). Remnants can still be seen of the brick wall of the warehouse, the jail, parts of one of the mills, the boiler, the walls and chimney of the powerhouse, the flywheel, and other machinery. The range lighthouse remains in use.  

Dean Udy was the last person to operate the Ontario Lumber Company’s store and post office. In the company’s early years, the store supplied employees with most staple goods. While no records survive to confirm the exact methods, it is presumed that Ontario Lumber ran their store in the same manner as other company stores of that era, paying employees in vouchers redeemable for goods. In October 1922 the store and post office closed permanently.
