## History of Northern Parry Sound District

At about the same time as agricultural settlement commenced in northern Parry Sound District, lumbermen came by way of Georgian Bay to tap the rich pine stands adjacent to the rivers flowing into it. One of the first was the Walkerton Lumber Company which came to the mouth of the French River, then went up the Pickerel River. Their furthest operation upstream was at Kidd’s Landing. In 1882, Mr H. H. Cook of Toronto organised the Ontario Lumber Company and bought out the Walkerton Lumber Company. Men and supplies for their camps were brought across Georgian Bay in big paddle-wheel boats to the French River, then in smaller boats or pointers up the Pickerel River to Kidd’s Landing, which was the end of navigation. From there, tote roads were built, extending back into the uncut stands.

In the early days Ontario Lumber Company established a depot camp about Lot 30, Concession XX, McConkey Township. Some ten or fifteen years later, they moved their depot camp to Lot 13, Concession IX, McConkey Township. These depot camps were used as headquarters for supplies and for summer pasture for the horses.

Other companies of the period were the Turner Lumber Company, Holland-Graves (later Graves & Bigwood), Hardy Lumber Company and McCormack & Irwin. They held limits in McKenzie, Mowat, Brown, Wilson, Hardy and Ferrie Townships. Tote roads were cut from Bynoe, following up the Still River as far east as Wilson Township, and up the Magnetawan River into McKenzie Township. After 1910 many of the companies went out of business and others took over their licences. The Pine Lake Lumber Company took over the Ontario Lumber Company’s limits, the Parry Sound Lumber Company operated in Wilson and Brown Townships, later moving to Blair Township and erecting a mill at Lost Channel. The Holt Timber Company logged in McKenzie, and Manly Chew in Wilson and Brown Townships.

Compared with modern mechanised logging, the earlier operations were very primitive, the tools crude, and the amenities of the lumberjack’s life very meagre. The first camps were of the camboose type — a big, low, square log building. The men slept on pole bunks around the outer walls; a big open fireplace in the centre of the building provided heat, and in it the cook made the meals that consisted chiefly of bread, molasses, beans, fat pork and tea. The bread was baked in iron bake kettles buried in hot sand and the pork and beans were cooked in big iron pots hung over the fire. A hole was left in the roof for the smoke to escape. Lumberjacks carried big jack-knives which were also used as table knives, and fingers substituted for forks. They filled their tin plates and tea dishes with food and tea from pots at the fire, then went back and sat on benches attached to their bunks to eat. Later, when stoves came into use, a separate cookery was built and the men had tables at which to eat.

The equipment used in logging was very crude and no effort was made to conserve manpower. The axes were very good and the men were expert in their use, but the first crosscut saws were poor. The trees were felled with the axe, butted if necessary, and topped with the axe. Crosscut saws were only used for separating the trunk of the tree into logs. Instances can still be seen in the woods where the old-time chopper cut through a tree three times with his axe (felled, butted and topped) and one saw cut was made to get two logs out of the tree. Teams of horses skidded the logs to main roads where they were rolled into skidways by men using canthooks. Decking lines and jammers were not in use then. In the winter, the logs were hauled on huge sleighs by horses to the nearest stream or lake to be driven downstream the next spring to Georgian Bay and towed in big rafts to the sawmills. On the sleigh haul the days were long and arduous — the lead teams left the camp for work about 3 a.m. and it was often 9 p.m. when the tail team got back to camp. Coal oil torches were used in the woods to show light for loading logs in the early morning.

A logging project which helped to open up the country was a tote road known as the Pickerel Hills Road, which the Ontario Lumber Company built from their depot camp (mentioned above) south to connect with the Great North Road at Glenila in the southern part of Ferrie Township. This gave them winter access to their camps from Parry Sound, Rosseau and Gravenhurst, which was then the end of the steel from the Grand Trunk Railway. Albert McCallum (popularly called “Mac”) used to carry the mail from the Ontario Lumber Company’s five camps. He would leave their depot camp in the northern part of McConkey Township in the morning, have dinner at Glenila, then go to Dunchurch, pick up the mail and any other small necessities (usually about 50 pounds), and return to spend the night at Glenila, travelling a distance of 62 miles. He would leave Glenila the next morning, arriving back at the depot camp at noon, another 35 miles. This was a weekly expedition for “Mac”. While making this 100-mile trip, he would not walk over a couple of miles. He had a lope that carried him at wonderful speed and he never seemed to tire. Mr McCallum later went into the logging business, taking out timber in McKenzie and Hagerman Townships for Graves & Bigwood.

## Warping Tugs “Alligator”

This vehicle was widely used in the lumber period.  

This tug was a flat-bottomed barge, square at both ends, powered by a steam boiler operating a one-cylinder steam engine. The engine turned paddle wheels on each side. The gears could be shifted to engage a large drum on which was wound one mile of one-inch steel cable.

Under paddle wheel the tug would proceed with the boom to about the full length of the cable, then a large anchor was dropped and the tug returned to the log boom. The gears were then shifted and the cable slowly wound up on the drum, thus pulling the log boom ahead, reaching its final destination by this method. By laying logs to act as rollers, the warping tugs could pull themselves across portages from one lake or river to the next. The biggest and most time-consuming job on a portage was carrying water by pails to keep the boiler full. This type of barge or tug played a very important role in the lumbering period in this area.

The tug *Evelyn*, used by the French River Boom Company on French River, sank off Britt in the spring of 1915 on its trip back to French River Mouth from Midland, where it had been for repairs. No one was drowned in the sinking. Photo courtesy Bruce Thompson.
