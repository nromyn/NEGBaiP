title:  "Birth of Northeastern Georgian Bay"

The birth of the northeastern Georgian Bay region is a many-faceted event. On one side is the "Big Bang" and the age-long accumulation of solids and gases which became the planet Earth. Another side is the billions of years during which the Earth's crust was formed amid widespread volcanism and tempestuous storms that raged over the Earth for hundreds of millions of years without a drop of rain, and then came gigantic rainstorms, slowly decreasing vaporization, streams, lakes, inland seas, and a great ocean.

The time is about 2.5 billion years ago, and the Earth is two billion years old. The region which will become northeastern Georgian Bay is not yet conceived but its parents, the elements, are reaching maturity. And it lies thousands of miles east and south of its present location.
In the direction of present Sudbury, great cracks rent the Earth's crust releasing molten rock from its interior. Vast regions are covered with a thick pile of volcanic rocks containing some iron, copper, zinc, nickel, gold and silver. Locally, the base metals form deposits in combination with oxygen and sulphur which carry with them some of the gold and silver. Some of the iron is destined to reach Key Harbour but, still, northeastern Georgian Bay is not yet born.
Then, almost two billion years ago, a great inland sea develops, and a neck of this sea passes through the region. Sediments from the erosion of rocks in the direction of Sudbury are deposited in the sea and rocks of the region are born. They are layered rocks, simple sands and shales and they must yet mature. The region is still far to the east and south.

Northeastern Georgian Bay rocks consolidate and are gently warped over a period of some 800 million years before the area is violently stressed by a series of Earth-shaking events as its passes from adolescence to maturity. Great rifts again crack the Earth's crust. The Canadian Shield with its newborn Georgian Bay region starts moving to the northwest and, early in this process, it and adjacent regions are pushed upward to molten rock under great pressure. As the molten rock moves upward it assimilates some of the layered rocks and thoroughly recrystallizes those immediately above. Only the bedding planes and varied tones of gray remain as evidence of their former character. The setting is complete, the molten rock congeals and crystallizes to a pink granite with its top at an elevation varying above and below the present level of Georgian Bay. The area is mature but remains covered by hundreds of feet of overlying sediments to be removed. As the region ages, through erosion and glacial gouging, it moves further northwest to its present location and is invaded by an inland freshwater sea.

The " present" has arrived. The region is as today. Gnarled scrub pine and cedar trees, moss, juniper and blueberry bush find scant sustenance in niches of sparse soil on bare rock. Peninsulas alternate with equally long and narrow baylets, home of the great northern pike. Occasional peninsulas and islands are pink granite, but most are the recrystallized layered rocks. The Key River and others in the region are found along fractures in the rocks and the same fractures dictate locations of deeper channels, favorites of the elusive, delicious walleye pickerel. Rocky shoals of glacial boulders, loved by the scrappy smallmouth bass, are strewn along extensions of the peninsulas. Prevailing southwest winds fan the waters and beckon the sailing limbs of the pine.
