# What’s So Great About This Place?

Ask Northeastern Georgian Bay fans why they are hooked, and you’ll get as many answers as asks. Here are some that stick in my memory:
    “Savage and serene”
    “If you don’t like the weather, wait five minutes”
    “…like those exaggerated postcards. You know, where the colours are printed too strong to be real.”
    “God created beauty. His masterpiece is Georgian Bay”

I can’t tell you who said which. Well, one I can – my wife said the one about postcard colour.
Most attempts to explain the region’s mystique, center around its powerful, unpredictable, natural beauty. Every turn of the head presents a different visual delight.

Water so blue you think you could dip a pen in it. Sparkling quartz and golden lichen on pink granite. Twisted, wind-tortured pines trailing long limbs leeward. And so clean! Even the carrion gulls are the world’s whitest.

Then those monotone gray North Wind days. When sports fishermen unsnarl tackle boxes, loons cry, and gulls scrunch together in drippy mist. Gray days placed, as any artist knows, for contrast. Until God says, with a rainbow, “Here comes colour again!”

But “our little corner of heaven” (a favourite) boasts still another beauty: beautiful people. Privacy respecting, supportive, convivial people of prevailing good humour.

Naturally.
