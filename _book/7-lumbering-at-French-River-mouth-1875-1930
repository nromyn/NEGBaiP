title:  "Lumbering at the French River Mouth, 1875–1930"

In 1872 the Honourable Thomas Foster, then Minister of Crown Lands of Ontario, obtained legislation and opened up a vast, previously untouched area to lumbering around the north-eastern shore of Georgian Bay and all rivers emptying into the Bay. This included the French River and all its tributaries.  

At this period of Ontario and Canada’s development (late 1800s to early 1900s), the cutting of the virgin pine forest, and the resulting lumbering, was a very important part of the country’s growth. The increased development of the industry in Georgian Bay was greatly encouraged by the reconstruction boom in the United States following the end of the Civil War and by increased immigration to Canada, especially Ontario.  

Large numbers of workers were required during the 40 to 50 years of this natural resource industry. At nearly all river mouths, mills and communities soon sprang up to accommodate the company workers and their families. Many such towns have now vanished.  

The lumberjacks, with axes and saws (mostly axes), cut these virgin forests from 80 to 100 miles inland for different lumber companies. The cutting areas were generally north and east from the French River mouth. Logging was done on both sides of the French, Pickerel, and Wanapitei Rivers, east to Lake Nipissing, and also west of the French River mouth to Voyageurs Channel. Most of these millions of logs were eventually processed through the mills or booming companies at Macdougal Bay, at the mouth of the French River, two miles inland from Georgian Bay.  

To process and produce finished lumber products from this vast timberland required large mills. The lumber companies and their mills were established at the mouth of the French River at Macdougal Bay. This location was the most central and accessible outlet to Georgian Bay and eventually to the vast commerce of the Great Lakes by boat and barge.

## "Wabb Town" and "Coponaning" — French River Village  

Sam Wabb, brother-in-law of Peter McIntosh, the father of John McIntosh, came to the French River mouth in the early 1870s to trade with local Indigenous peoples and others travelling the river. He was the first settler of European descent to make his home there.  

Sam built a large store and trading post, docks, and a house for his family. The buildings were located on the east shore of Macdougal Bay below the Dalles Rapids.  

Shortly after Sam arrived, and as the area was opened up to lumbering, companies obtained cutting leases and moved in. One of the first was the Walkerton Lumber Company, though they carried out little cutting in the early years compared to what followed. Around 1875 the companies began to build mills and townsites for their employees.  

Seeing the possibilities for additional income, Wabb built six to eight rough houses to rent to workers who were building and operating the mills. This small original settlement was appropriately called *Wabb Town*.  

After he was established there, his wife’s family, the Moores, and their relatives the McIntoshes from Collingwood, came and settled in Wabb Town. Sam continued his business until his death in 1915. Mrs Wabb and his sons operated the store until the 1920s, when they moved to Simcoe County near Barrie.

## Coponaning  

In 1875 the Provincial Land Surveyor, Thomas Bolger from Belleville, was commissioned to survey a townsite at the mouth of the French River. He suggested the name *Coponaning*, for which the plan was registered. The town, however, did not develop immediately to any great extent until later years.

### Editor’s Notes  

- The original text used terms common to its time when referring to Indigenous peoples and early settlers. These have been updated for clarity and respect.  
- The description of Sam Wabb as the “first white man to settle” has been reframed as “first settler of European descent,” recognising long-standing Indigenous presence in the region.
